Furthermore, how can
someone simply point to
the book of a lower and
claim that a rising crime
rate is the cause?
Perhaps the area is
simply {filled^2|infested^5} with
problems? Perhaps there
has been a small number
of crime committers that
have been very active. It
is all very *49*28*{inconclusive|accusatory}. @P
