Scene should be set up with all the objects needed. If you run the game without changing anything, you should have "Hey you" appear on
screen on top of each other. Now after that, click on GameObject that under Canvas. Uncheck the Instantiate Text script in the Inspector.
Then click on the Text object under Canvas and check the Text Read script in the Inspector. Run the game. It crashes Unity on my setup.
What's crashing the game (at least for me) is the code from instantiateText.cs. Pretty much everything inside void Start(){} of instantiateText
is inside void Start(){} of TextRead.cs. No idea why it's happening but yeah.
